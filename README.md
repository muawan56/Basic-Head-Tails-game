# Head or Tails Game

This is a simple JavaScript-based "Heads or Tails" game where you can play against the computer. The game keeps track of your wins and losses using localStorage.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can click the "Heads" or "Tails" buttons to make your choice, and the computer will randomly select "heads" or "tails." The game will display the result and update your score.

## Resetting the Score

If you want to reset your score, you can click the "Reset" button, and the wins and losses will be cleared.
